# Week 2 - Refactoring: Break It Up

The subject problem for this week's code kata comes from [this Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/). Feel free to read through the problem on the site, but I'll include the instructions [here](./problem.md) for posterity.

The current `addTwoNumbers` implementation is "working" (the tests pass)... So why change it?

This week, we'll practice breaking up a function into re-usable components and make our function easier to read and maintain long term. Start by refactoring the `addTwoNumbers` function. Remember - the tests should still pass. The variable names are sub-par at best, so that will be part of the challenge in determining how to best break it up.

If you finish early and have a beautiful, simple, elegant and functioning implementation of `addTwoNumbers`, you can start refactoring and simplifying the test code in the same way. As you'll see, it's also a travesty of unreadability.
